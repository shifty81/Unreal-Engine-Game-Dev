### Prerequisites
- **Unreal Engine 5.6.1** (or compatible 5.6.x version)
- **Visual Studio 2022** (Windows) with:
  - Desktop development with C++ workload
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è Including **MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools (Latest)**
  - Game development with C++ workload
  - .NET desktop development
  - Windows 10/11 SDK (latest version)
- **Xcode** (Mac) - for macOS development
- **16GB RAM minimum** (32GB recommended)

### Quick Setup (Experienced Users)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** You **MUST** build in Visual Studio BEFORE opening the .uproject file!

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shifty81/Unreal-Engine-Game-Dev.git
   cd Unreal-Engine-Game-Dev
   ```

2. **Generate project files** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Don't skip this!**
   
   - Right-click `VoxelSurvival.uproject`
   - Select "Generate Visual Studio project files"
   - Wait for the process to complete (30-60 seconds)
   
   > **Common Error:** If you get "modules are missing or built with a different engine version",
   > you skipped this step! See [SETUP_GUIDE.md](SETUP_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

3. **Build the project** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Required before opening!**
   - Open the generated `VoxelSurvival.sln` file
   - Select configuration: **"Development Editor"**
   - Select platform: **"Win64"**
   - Build the solution (Build ‚Üí Build Solution or Ctrl+Shift+B)
   - Wait for successful build (5-15 minutes)

4. **Open in Unreal Engine** ‚úÖ **Only after successful build!**
   - Double-click `VoxelSurvival.uproject`
   - First launch takes 5-10 minutes (shader compilation)

## Most Common Issue ‚ö†Ô∏è

**"The following modules are missing or built with a different engine version: VoxelSurvival, ExampleMod"**

This error means you opened the `.uproject` file **before** building in Visual Studio. 

**Solution:**
1. Close the error dialog (click "No")
2. Follow the correct order: Generate Project Files ‚Üí Build in Visual Studio ‚Üí Open in Unreal Engine
3. See [SETUP_GUIDE.md](SETUP_GUIDE.md) for detailed visual instructions

**Never click "Yes" to rebuild** - the editor cannot rebuild without proper project files!

## Common Issues

Having trouble building the project? Check these common solutions:

- **"The following modules are missing or built with a different engine version"** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MOST COMMON**
  - You opened `.uproject` before building in Visual Studio
  - **DO NOT** click "Yes" to rebuild
  - Close editor, generate project files, build in VS, then open .uproject
  - See [SETUP_GUIDE.md](SETUP_GUIDE.md#issue-1-missing-or-built-with-different-engine-version-) for step-by-step fix

- **"Build tools for Visual Studio 2022 (v143) cannot be found"**
  - Make sure Visual Studio 2022 is installed with C++ workloads
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL:** Must include **"MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools (Latest)"** component
  - Open Visual Studio Installer ‚Üí Modify ‚Üí Desktop development with C++ ‚Üí Check Installation details panel for v143
  - Regenerate project files (right-click `.uproject` ‚Üí Generate Visual Studio project files)
  - See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#visual-studio-2022-build-tools-not-found) for detailed steps

- **"Platform 'Win64' referenced in the project file cannot be found"**
  - This often appears with the v143 error above - check v143 build tools are installed first
  - Delete old project files and regenerate them
  - Make sure you open `VoxelSurvival.sln` in the project root, NOT files in Intermediate folder
  - See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#win64-platform-cannot-be-found)

- **Project won't open in Unreal Engine**
  - Verify Unreal Engine 5.6.1 is installed
  - Right-click `.uproject` ‚Üí Switch Unreal Engine version
  - See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#missing-unreal-engine-association)

- **"Magick.NET-Q16-HDRI-AnyCPU vulnerability" warning** üîí
  - This is a **false positive** - the project doesn't use this package
  - No action required - your code is not affected
  - See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for detailed analysis
  - See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#magick-net-q16-hdri-anycpu-vulnerability-warning)
