# Voxel Survival - Unreal Engine 5.6.1

A comprehensive voxel-based survival game with RTS elements, featuring territory control, base building, ship construction, and full multiplayer support.

## Quick Start

This project is an Unreal Engine 5.6.1 game with full C++ source code.

### Prerequisites
- **Unreal Engine 5.6.1** (or compatible 5.6.x version)
- **Visual Studio 2022** (Windows) with:
  - Desktop development with C++ workload
  - Game development with C++ workload
  - .NET desktop development
  - Windows 10/11 SDK
- **Xcode** (Mac) - for macOS development
- **16GB RAM minimum** (32GB recommended)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shifty81/Unreal-Engine-Game-Dev.git
   cd Unreal-Engine-Game-Dev
   ```

2. **Generate project files**
   
   **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** You must generate Visual Studio project files before building!
   
   - Right-click `VoxelSurvival.uproject`
   - Select "Generate Visual Studio project files"
   - Wait for the process to complete
   
   > **Note:** If you get build errors about missing build tools or Win64 platform,
   > you likely skipped this step. See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for help.

3. **Build the project**
   - Open the generated `VoxelSurvival.sln` file
   - Select configuration: **"Development Editor"**
   - Select platform: **"Win64"**
   - Build the solution (Build ‚Üí Build Solution or Ctrl+Shift+B)

4. **Open in Unreal Engine**
   - Double-click `VoxelSurvival.uproject`

## Common Issues

Having trouble building the project? Check these common solutions:

- **"Build tools for Visual Studio 2022 (v143) cannot be found"**
  - Make sure Visual Studio 2022 is installed with C++ workloads
  - Regenerate project files (right-click `.uproject` ‚Üí Generate Visual Studio project files)
  - See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#visual-studio-2022-build-tools-not-found)

- **"Platform 'Win64' referenced in the project file cannot be found"**
  - Delete old project files and regenerate them
  - Make sure you open `VoxelSurvival.sln`, not files in Intermediate folder
  - See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#win64-platform-cannot-be-found)

- **Project won't open in Unreal Engine**
  - Verify Unreal Engine 5.6.1 is installed
  - Right-click `.uproject` ‚Üí Switch Unreal Engine version
  - See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#missing-unreal-engine-association)
