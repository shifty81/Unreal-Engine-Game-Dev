# Voxel Survival - Unreal Engine 5.6.1

A comprehensive voxel-based survival game with RTS elements, featuring territory control, base building, ship construction, and full multiplayer support.

## Quick Start

This project is an Unreal Engine 5.6.1 game with full C++ source code.

### Prerequisites
- Unreal Engine 5.6.1
- Visual Studio 2022 (Windows) or Xcode (Mac)
- 16GB RAM minimum

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shifty81/Unreal-Engine-Game-Dev.git
   cd Unreal-Engine-Game-Dev
   ```

2. **Generate project files**
   - Right-click `VoxelSurvival.uproject`
   - Select "Generate Visual Studio project files"

3. **Build the project**
   - Open `VoxelSurvival.sln`
   - Build in "Development Editor" configuration

4. **Open in Unreal Engine**
   - Double-click `VoxelSurvival.uproject`

## Core Systems

### Voxel System
- Chunk-based world management (16x16x16 voxels per chunk)
- Optimized procedural mesh generation
- Multiple voxel types (Stone, Dirt, Grass, Wood, Iron, Gold)
- Save/load functionality for persistence

### Survival System
- Health with damage and healing
- Hunger and thirst mechanics
- Stamina system
- Inventory management (expandable)

### Territory System
- Grid-based territory ownership
- Influence spreading from buildings
- Real-time territory updates
- Build restrictions based on control

### Ship Building
- Modular component system
- Save/load ship designs
- Hangar construction and storage
- Customizable ship properties

## Development Status

**Current Phase: Core Systems Complete**

- [x] Voxel world implementation
- [x] World generation system
- [x] Character and survival mechanics
- [x] Territory control system
- [x] Building system
- [x] Ship building and hangar
- [x] Multiplayer foundation
- [x] Modding infrastructure

**Next Phase: Enhanced Features**

## Multiplayer

The game fully supports multiplayer with:
- Client-server architecture
- Network replication for all game objects
- Territory synchronization
- Ship and building replication

**To host a multiplayer game:**
```bash
# Listen Server (via editor)
Play â†’ Net Mode â†’ "Play As Listen Server"

# Dedicated Server (command line)
UE4Editor.exe "YourPath/VoxelSurvival.uproject" -server -log
```

## Modding

The game is designed for extensive modding:
- Plugin system support
- Data-driven design
- Serializable game data
- Blueprint extensibility
