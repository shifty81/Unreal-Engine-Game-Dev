# Implementation Summary - Voxel Survival Game

## Project Overview

A complete Unreal Engine 5.6.1 voxel-based survival game with RTS elements has been created from scratch in this repository. The project includes all requested features and is ready for further development.

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ Core Voxel System

**VoxelData.h**
- Voxel type enumeration (Air, Stone, Dirt, Grass, Wood, Iron, Gold, Custom)
- FVoxelData structure with health and custom data support
- Solid/non-solid detection

**VoxelChunk (Actor)**
- 16x16x16 chunk management
- Procedural mesh generation with optimization (only visible faces)
- Voxel get/set operations
- Serialization support for saving/loading
- Network replication ready
- Color-coded voxel rendering

**VoxelWorld (Actor)**
- Chunk loading/unloading based on player position
- Procedural terrain generation using noise
- Customizable world parameters (seed, height scale, noise frequency)
- Render distance management
- Save/load world data support

### ✅ Survival Mechanics

**WireframeCharacter (Character)**
- Health system with damage and healing
- Hunger mechanic (decreases over time)
- Thirst mechanic (decreases faster than hunger)
- Stamina system (regenerates when idle)
- Inventory system (expandable)
- Starvation/dehydration damage
- Full network replication

### ✅ RTS Elements

**TerritorySystem (Actor)**
- Grid-based territory ownership
- Influence spreading from buildings
- Automatic territory updates every 5 seconds
- Build restrictions based on ownership
- Multiplayer synchronization

**BuildingSystem (ABuilding Actor)**
- Base building class with health
- Owner assignment
- Influence radius and generation
- Damage and repair systems
- Network replication

### ✅ Ship Building System

**Ship (Pawn)**
- Modular component-based design
- FShipComponent structure for ship parts
- Add/remove component functionality
- Rebuild ship mesh from components
- Serialize/deserialize ship designs
- Floating pawn movement
- Network replication

**Hangar (Building)**
- Ship construction facility
- Construction progress tracking
- Ship storage (up to 10 ships)
- Deploy stored ships
- Construction speed configuration

### ✅ Multiplayer Support

All systems include:
- Network replication (`bReplicates = true`)
- Replicated properties with `DOREPLIFETIME`
- Authority checks (`HasAuthority()`)
- Client-server architecture
- Synchronized game state

### ✅ Modding Infrastructure

**Plugin Support**
- Example plugin template included
- Data-driven design throughout
- Serialization for custom content
- Blueprint extensibility
- Module loading system

**Extensibility**
- Easy to add new voxel types
- Building system is extendable
- Ship components are modular
- World generation is customizable
- Data tables ready for use
